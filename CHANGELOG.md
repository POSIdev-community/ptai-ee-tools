+ [Fix] Ant and Slf4J dependencies are removed from Jenkins's plugin pom.xml file as those JARs versions are managed by parent org.jenkins-ci.plugins artifact that maintains actual BOM of dependencies in accordance with jenkins.version variable, see details [here](https://github.com/jenkinsci/plugin-pom).
+ [Feature] CLI plugin --use-default-excludes parameter added
### 20210414

### 20210616
+ [Feature] REST API naming refactored from <service>.<version> to <version>.<service>
+ [ToDo] Check API calls that return file. Those files are created as temp so it is better to explicitly delete them
+ [ToDo] Reorganize test fixtures: place data parser tests to ptai-rest-api
+ [ToDo] Refactor data structures. Currently plugins like Jenkins one use data types defined in ptai-rest-api and those types are version-dependent. This may cause a problems with plugins update
+ [Fix] ```@NotNull``` changed to Lombok's ```@NonNull```
+ [Fix] Smarter Jenkins plugins version number calculation implemented in build.gradle
+ [Fix] Full / incremental scan mode fixed
### 20210617

+ [Feature] Build timestamp format changed to ISO 8601
+ [ToDo] Fix stacked area chart area order
### 20210620
+ [Feature] Scan results data structures refactoring started. Previously plugins like Jenkins used data types defined in ptai-rest-api and those types are version-dependent. This could cause a problems with plugins update as that data stored as an XML representation of Actions
### 20210621
+ [Feature] Project- and build-scope actions are temporarily disabled
### 20210812
+ [Fix] Major code refactoring complete
+ [Feature] Jenkins plugin now supports charts

### 20210813
+ [Fix] Scans stopped from CI are terminated in PT AI server
+ [ToDo] Implement enqueued project scan stop from plugin. This requires current scan stage monitoring and if scan isn't started yet, need to delete scan result instead of scan stop
+ [ToDo] Implement UI for terminated / incomplete scans
### 20210817
+ [Fix] Jenkins VirtualChannel throws exception that is inherited from Throwable instead of Exception. But CallHelper processes ava.util.concurrent.Callable lambdas that throw Exception. That means that CallHelper can't process VirtualChannel exceptions and some JDK's like OpenJDK 8 raises build error here. So I had to implement own Callable inside CallHelper that throws Throwable
+ [Feature] Jenkins plugin logo changed. Now it uses icon from PT AI IDE plugins
### 20210819
+ [Fix] Fixed scan settings change for second and following scans
+ [Feature] UI for terminated / incomplete scans implemented for Jenkins plugin

+ [Fix] Jenkins plugin version fixed (old Jenkins versions show that data at the very top of screen)
+ [Feature] Multilanguage (EN and RU) scan brief implemented
### 20210826
+ [Feature] Raw scan result now contains localized description

+ [Fix] Jenkins pipeline job PT AI actions fixed
### 20210914
+ [Fix] JWT refresh fixed
+ [Feature] SignalR version update 1.0.0 -> 5.0.9. Need this to check if websocket proxy connection issue can be fixed
+ [Feature] Advanced settings class implemented. Use ```-Dptai.http.response.max.body.size="10"``` Java parameter to restrict HTTP response body size to store to logs
### 20210916
+ [Fix] Use of LastBuildAction allows plugin to show project-scope actions both for pipeline and freestyle jobs. But this works only if there were at least one successful build (see https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-28479). Added getProjectActions for build step to fix that for at least freestyle projects
+ [Fix] jcenter.bintray.com repository not available. Replaced with https://download.jetbrains.com/teamcity-repository
### 20210927
+ [Fix] "Fail-if-failed" and "fail-if-unstable" settings for Jenkins plugin are changed from boolean to enum. This allows us to mark build step as unstable and thus allow AST results save in pipeline jobs

+ [Fix] CLI plugin project delete error fixed
### 20211006
+ [Feature] More logging added to report generation
### 20211019
+ [Fix] Bug with custom connection settings in Jenkins pipeline jobs fixed

### 20211102
+ [Fix] Integration tests for incremental scans are removed as those may fail

+ [Fix] Fixed FileCollector bug where it doesn't add folder entries to zipped file. Processing of such zip files sometimes fails on a PT AI server
### 20220228

### 20220812
+ [Feature] WebGoat.NET source code added
+ [Fix] PT AI 4.0 and 4.1 both require C# solution file name started with "./" while 3.6 doesn't. Checks and fixes are added to AiProjConverters
+ [Fix] Sources upload step moved from GenericAstJob to SetupOperations and ProjectTasks implementations. This is done because C# projects require solution file to be uploaded already before project setup. Otherwise we'll get error {"errorCode":"INVALID_JSON_FIELDS","details":{"additionalParams.solutionFile":"NotExist"}} while calling https://{url}/api/projects/{projectId}/settings
+ [Fix] Removed x-enum-varnames from DotNetProjectType as both 4.0 and 4.1 use string enums
### 20220825
+ [Feature] Advanced setting ast.result.rest.url.filename added. If its value is defined then AST result URL will be saved to corresponding file

+ [Fix] BaseIssue's isNew implemented instead of isNewInScanResultId
+ [Fix] SCA issue title fixed
### 20221108
+ [Fix] JWT and API tokens are masked in trace logs by default. To override this behaviour set `ptai.logging.http.credentials` advanced setting to `true`

If parameter value does not equals to "value", that parameter name is added as "checkDependsOn" attribute and JS event listener added to corresponding UI control (see registerValidator in hudson-behaviour.js). That means that, for example, previous doCheckJsonSettings will be called twice: first time as checker attached to onchange event and second time - as onchange listener for jsonSettings field from checkDependsOn attribute

+ [Fix] As Jenkins [recommends](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/developer/plugin-development/dependency-management/#jenkins-plugin-bom) using plugin BOM dependency, all explicit credentials / token-macro / etc. plugin version calculations are removed
### 20231214
+ [Feature] Advanced setting ast.diagnostic.json.filename added. Its value defines file name where AST job execution details like scan status, PT AI agent name, policy assessment result, etc. will be saved to
